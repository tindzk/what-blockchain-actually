First, see [[Commitment Hash]]. Merkle trees can be seen as a special form of a commitment hash, where similar to any form of hashing of data, the root of the tree is a commitment to the entire data.

In a [[Merkle Tree]], the data is organized in the leafs of the tree, and all intermediate nodes (and the root) are merely the hashes of their children.

Merkle trees have two interesting properties for blockchains and their needs. 
- If we update node `J`, only nodes `J`, `F`, `C` and `A` have to be updated to have a fresh new root and [[Commitment Hash]] to the entire data. The complexity of number of hashes is $O(2 + \log_{2}{n})$. This is an overhead compared to hashing `[H, I, J, K]` just once, but the justification of it can be seen in the next point.
- If we want to prove to Alice, who only knows `A` (the [[State Root]]), what the value of `J` is, we could send her: `J`, `G` and `B`, and that's all that she needs to know. 
	- Knowing `J`, she can compute `F = Hash(J)`. Then, having received `G`, she can compute `C = Hash(F|G)`. With `C` and `B`, she can recompute `A`, and if it matches her copy of `A`, she can be sure that data she received was correct. 
	- We hadn't used a merkle tree, we would have to send the entire `[H, I, J, K]`  to Alice to prove to her that `J` is part of the set. This would have a $O(n)$ complexity. With a tree of depth 3 like above, the difference of $O(log_{2}{n})$ and $O(n)$ is not very bold, but rest assured in a database of billions of items, it is a big deal.

This mechanism is used in [[Block Header]] to store:
- State root: Merkle tree of the entire blockchain state.
- Transaction root: merkel tree of all of the transactions in the block.
Moreover, it is a key piece of how [[Blockchain Networks#Light Node]] request [[State Proof]]s and operate.
